# bretts-calendar
For the calendar I have the set date which is shown upon loading the page. Followed is the calendar itself which has time blocks for each hour of the work day. A text area was placed in the center section of each hour block so the user can input notes. To the right is the save button which up click will save any data that is writen inside of the hour row. The colors of the hour row will also change depending on the time of day. If the row is gray that means the time has already passed. If the row is red then that is the current hour of the day. If a row is green that means that that time hasn't passed yet. Moment.js is used in this calendar.
